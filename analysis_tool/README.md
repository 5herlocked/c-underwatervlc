# Analysis Tool

The analysis tool is meant specifically to condense a video's Region of Interest (the area of the LED)
into pure numbers in a CSV file seperated as follows: (deltaTime, blue, green, red, bit). This is to ease
future processing steps since we have the relevant data condensed into 5 sets of `Float64` numbers rather
than having to process large video files at every step of the way.
