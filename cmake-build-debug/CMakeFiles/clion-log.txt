CMake Error at zed_record/CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindZED.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "ZED", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ZED" (requested
  version 3) with any of the following names:

    ZEDConfig.cmake
    zed-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ZED" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "ZED_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "ZED" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
